            <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
            <pre>
            <p><b>Hypertext Markup Language <u>(HTML)</u></b> is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web 
                applications.
            Web browsers receive <u>HTML</u> documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents 
            into multimedia web pages. <u>HTML</u> describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally 
            included cues for the appearance of the document.
            <u>HTML</u> elements are the building blocks of <u>HTML</u> pages. With <u>HTML</u>constructs, images and other objects 
            such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. <u>HTML</u> provides a means to create 
            structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, 
            quotes and other items. <u>HTML</u> elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as 
             &#8249;img /&#8250; and  &#8249;input /&#8250; directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as  &#8249;p&#8250; surround and 
             provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not
              display the <u>HTML</u> tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
            </p>

            <h2>Markup</h2>
            <p><u>HTML</u> markup consists of several key components, including those called tags<i>(and their attributes)</i>, character-based data types, character references and entity references. <u>HTML</u> tags most commonly come in pairs like  &#8249;h1 &#8250; and  &#8249;/h1 &#8250;, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example &#8249;img&#8250;. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag <i>(they are also called opening tags and closing tags)</i>.
            </p>
            <p>Another important component is the <u>HTML</u> <i>document type declaration,</i> which triggers standards mode rendering.</p>

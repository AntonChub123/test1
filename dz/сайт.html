        <h3>Linear Equations</h3>
        <p>
            A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form 
        </p>
       <h4 id="one"><span id="two"> ax + b = 0</span> </h4>
        <p>where <span id="sp"> a</span> and <span id="sp">b</span> are real numbers and <span id="sp">x</span> is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear 
            equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. , the variable may or may not be an <span id="sp">x</span> 
            so don’t get too locked into always seeing an <span id="sp">x</span> there.</p>
            <h4>Quadratic Equation</h4>
            <p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>
            <h5 id="s"><span id="w">ax^2 + bx + c = 0  </span></h5>
            <p>where <spam id="sp">a, b, c</spam> are known values and <span id="sp">x</span> is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, <span id="sp">a</span> can't be 0.</p>
            <h3>The area of a circle (A)</h3>
            <p> (Pi) times the radius (r) squared:</p>
            <h5>A = [sign] [sign] r^2  </h5>
